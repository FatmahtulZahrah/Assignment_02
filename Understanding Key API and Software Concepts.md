## |Key Terms

- API  
- SDK  
- Web APIs  
- Library APIs  
- Prompting and Completion 

## |Define API 

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows one application to communicate with another.APIs can be private (used internally), public (shared with third parties), or partner-specific.
They use request and response formats like JSON or XML for data exchange.
APIs can be RESTful (using HTTP) or based on other architectures like GraphQL.
- ***Example:*** A weather app fetching live weather data from a weather service API.

## |Define SDK

An SDK (Software Development Kit) is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that developers use to create software applications for a specific platform.SDKs provide a complete environment for development on a specific platform.
SDKs simplify tasks like integrating device features (camera, GPS).
They are often tailored to platforms like iOS, Android, or gaming engines.
They improve efficiency by offering pre-built components and guidelines.
- ***Example:*** The Android SDK includes APIs and tools for building Android apps.

## |Define Web APIs

Web APIs are APIs that operate over the internet using HTTP protocols, enabling interaction with web services.Web APIs enable applications to interact with web-based services via HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
They are commonly used for accessing data from cloud services, like weather or stock prices.
RESTful APIs are widely used because they are lightweight and easy to implement.
Authentication for Web APIs often involves tokens, keys, or OAuth protocols.
- ***Example:*** The Twitter API lets developers access and manage tweets programmatically.

## |Define Library APIs

Libraries are collections of pre-written code that perform specific tasks.
Library APIs expose functions or classes for developers to use directly in their applications.
They are language-specific and tailored for certain tasks (e.g., NumPy for scientific computing in Python).
Libraries save time by providing tested and optimized solutions for common problems.
They are typically imported into the developer’s code and used with minimal setup.
- ***Example:*** The Math library in Python provides APIs like math.sqrt() to calculate square roots.

## |Define Prompting

Prompting refers to giving an input or instruction to a language model to elicit a desired response or action.The prompt provides context, guiding the model on what kind of output is expected.Prompting and completion is a core feature of AI language models like GPT.
- ***Example:*** Asking, "Summarize the benefits of renewable energy" as a prompt will result in a concise explanation.

## |Define Completion

Completion is the response generated by a language model based on the given prompt.It serves as the model’s attempt to predict the next words, sentences, or outputs that align with the prompt.
- ***Example:*** For the prompt “Translate ‘How are you?’ into Spanish,” the completion might be “¿Cómo estás?”
